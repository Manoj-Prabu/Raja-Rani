# Raja-Rani
Raja-Rani is just one of the Indian childhood games, where raja need to find rani and rani need to find minister and so on.

## Rules
Once the characters assigned to the players:
- King need to find Queen
- Queen need to find Minister
- Minister need to find Police
- Police need to find Thief
- For example if the King misjudged some other char as Queen, then the character exchange between the players. This is same for all other players
- If a player misjudged, who&#39;s char is already found out, then character exchange won&#39;t happen and also 1 point will be reduced for that player
- The point system was like King = 4, Queen = 3, Minister = 2, Police = 1, Thief = 0
